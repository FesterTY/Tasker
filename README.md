## Key Features
1. **The ability to keep track of your todos with a click of a button** - Want to add a todo? Bam. It's done. Or delete one? Bam. Destruction's done. 
2. **Responsive Web Design** - Add your todos anywhere, and still have that same look, and feel of Tasker.
3. **Authentication** - Only registered accounts have the ability to delete/create todos. This is to ensure that the todos are kept clean, and manageable at all time.
4. **Utilizes the latest Firebase's Firestore database** - Although, it is new. The database runs significantly fast to ensure that users can keep track of their todos as fast as possible.
5. **Built-in notifications** - Get notified globally on the dashboard whether someone signed up, or simply created their todos.
